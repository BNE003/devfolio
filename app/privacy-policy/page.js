Thank you for using VoteFlow ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal and non-personal information when you use our service.

1. Information We Collect

1.1 Personal Data (Developer Accounts)

We collect the following personal information from developers who use VoteFlow:

Name: We collect your name to personalize your experience and communicate with you effectively.
Email: We collect your email address to send you important information regarding your subscription, updates, and communication.
Payment Information: We collect payment details to process your subscription securely. However, we do not store your payment information on our servers. Payments are processed by trusted third-party payment processors (Stripe).

1.2 User-Generated Content (App Users)

VoteFlow collects and stores the following data submitted by your app users through the SDK:
- Feature requests (title, description)
- Votes (associated with device identifiers)
- Comments (author name, text)
- Device identifiers (for preventing duplicate voting)

This data is stored on behalf of the app developer and is accessible through the developer's dashboard.

1.3 Non-Personal Data

We may use web cookies and similar technologies to collect non-personal information such as your IP address, browser type, device information, and browsing patterns. This information helps us to enhance your browsing experience, analyze trends, and improve our services.

2. Purpose of Data Collection

We collect and use personal data for:
- Account management and authentication
- Order processing and subscription management
- Providing the VoteFlow service and SDK functionality
- Customer support
- Service improvements and analytics

User-generated content is collected to enable the core functionality of VoteFlow: allowing app users to submit, vote on, and discuss feature requests.

3. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with any third parties except as required for service operation (e.g., sharing your information with payment processors). We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

App developers have full access to the feature requests, votes, and comments submitted by their app users through the VoteFlow dashboard.

4. Data Storage and Security

All data is stored securely using Supabase infrastructure with encryption at rest and in transit. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information.

5. Children's Privacy

VoteFlow is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email address provided below.
